Download GLM from http://sourceforge.net/projects/ogl-math/files/

Extract glm from the folder and include it in the project directory

Right click on the project in the solution viewer -> Choose Configuration Properties ->
	C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories
	
Edit the include to have the GLM folder path
It should be something like C:/projects/SpaceCombat/glm-0.9.4.6/glm

The project should now be able to find the glm header
